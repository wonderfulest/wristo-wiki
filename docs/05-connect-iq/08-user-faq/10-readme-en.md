## **When will the metric data display units?**

**Answer:** The metric data will display units when the "ShowUnit" setting is enabled, and the combined length of the data item and its unit is less than or equal to "MaxFieldLength". 

If these conditions are met, the unit will be shown; otherwise, only the numeric value will be displayed. Make sure to correctly configure the parameters to ensure the desired unit display.

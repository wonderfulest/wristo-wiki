Dear Pavel,

I'm so sorry for not checking my email over the weekend, hence replying to you only now. What I need is a screenshot of the settings page for Garmin Connect IQ.
Just like the picture below.

you can get the picture from connect IQ App settings

Then, I will send you an activation code, and you will need to enter it into the 'Activation Key' field.

If you enjoy using my watch face, you can buy me a beer. https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/muyids
